   * @global        Bridge
   *
   * @description   The Bridge global.
   *
   * @type          {Object}
   *
   * @property {Function} getDebug            This function returns the debug mode of Bridge.
   *
   * @property {Function} setDebug            This function sets the debug mode of Bridge.
   *
   * @property {Function} getErrors           This function returns the errors module from which all
   *                                          of the error types that Bridge uses to enumerate
   *                                          failures are visible.
   *
   * @property {Function} getIsAuthenticated  This function returns whether or not the current
   *                                          session has been authenticated by the API server.
   *
   * @property {Function} getRememberMe       This function returns the current "remember me" state
   *                                          of the application.
   *
   * @property {Function} getUser             This function returns the user profile object that you
   *                                          should use in your app that get be fetched from the
   *                                          API with getUserProfile() and updated on the API using
   *                                          updateUserProfile().
   *
   * @property {Function} authenticate        Makes an API call to request authentication. If the
   *                                          request is successful, a Bridge authentication cookie
   *                                          is set in the browser to identify the user from now
   *                                          on.
   *
   * @property {Function} getAuthToken        Gets the value of the Bridge authentication token from
   *                                          the browser's cookie store. If the authentication
   *                                          cookie is not set, this returns an empty string.
   *
   * @property {Function} forgotPassword      Makes an API call to request a password recovery email
   *                                          be sent to the given email address. recoverPassword()
   *                                          represents the completion of the recovery process.
   *
   * @property {Function} login               A convenience function that first authenticates the
   *                                          user and then goes on to fetch their user profile, if
   *                                          successful.
   *
   * @property {Function} logout              Clears the Bridge authentication cookie from the
   *                                          browser cookie store so the user is no longer
   *                                          authenticated.
   *
   * @property {Function} recoverPassword     Makes an API call to complete the password recovery
   *                                          process started by calling forgotPassword(). The user
   *                                          submits a new password and a unique hash sent to their
   *                                          email account to authorize the password change.
   *
   * @property {Function} register            Makes an API call to register a new user account. The
   *                                          user provides their email, password, first name, last
   *                                          name and an app-specific object that can store any
   *                                          additional data that your app requires. If email
   *                                          verification is enabled in the Bridge Server, then an
   *                                          email will be sent to the user's email address with a
   *                                          URL to follow to complete their registration. Their
   *                                          registration is completed by calling verifyEmail().
   *
   * @property {Function} request             This is the most general-purpose function for making
   *                                          API calls available to you. It takes the HTTP method,
   *                                          URL, and payload of your request and transmits it. You
   *                                          get a Q promise in return that you can use to handle
   *                                          success and failure of your request, whatever it may
   *                                          be.
   *
   * @property {Function} onRequestCalled     A callback function that allows you to attach special
   *                                          behaviour to every request call made by Bridge. This
   *                                          callback captures the HTTP method, URL, and the
   *                                          payload of each outgoing request before it is sent and
   *                                          gives you the opportunity to modify requests, if
   *                                          necessary.
   *
   * @property {Function} sendRequest         This function is the lowest-level implementation of
   *                                          XHR behaviour within Bridge. By default, it is
   *                                          configured to use the XmlHttpRequest object in JS to
   *                                          send requests, but can be overridden by another
   *                                          function of your own creation, as long as it is of the
   *                                          same signature. This is useful if you want to make a
   *                                          plugin for Bridge to interface with another library or
   *                                          framework such as AngularJS.
   *
   * @property {Function} isUserModified      Checks to see if the user object has been changed
   *                                          since the last time that getUserProfile() was called
   *                                          to get a fresh copy. This is helpful warn users that
   *                                          there are changes that must be saved.
   *
   * @property {Function} getUserProfile      Makes an API call to fetch an up-to-date copy of the
   *                                          user's profile. If this request is successful, the
   *                                          user object will be overwritten with a fresh copy.
   *
   * @property {Function} updateUserProfile   Makes an API call to submit the current user object to
   *                                          the database as the up-to-date copy. If successful,
   *                                          the user's profile in the database will be updated.
   *
   * @property {Function} verifyEmail         Makes an API call to complete the registration process
   *                                          started by calling register(). The user must supply a
   *                                          unique hash that was sent to their email address in
   *                                          order to verify their email address and authorize the
   *                                          activation of their account (if the Bridge Server has
   *                                          email verification enabled).
