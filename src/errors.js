 *                this state prevents the client from accessing any private routes on the API
 *                server, including deauthenticate(). core.request() handles this error by resetting
 *                the session, even though the auth cookie may still be set. Ideally, this is
 *                handled by returning the user to a login screen to re-enter their credentials so
 *                authenticate() will be called again, allowing the server to issue a fresh auth
 *                cookie and restore the app state.
